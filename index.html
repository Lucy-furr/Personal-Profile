            <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>Greetings!, I'm <b>Marc Allen C. Guillermo,</b> I'm a <b><i>BSIT
                    student</i></b> currently studying at <b>Tarlac State University</b> 
                    aspiring to be a <b>Software Engineer</b> or <b>Network Engineer</b> someday
                    and build a <i>startup business</i> like <b>bryl lim</b>, I was inspired by him
                    to create a <strong>startup business</strong> like his <a href="https://www.pocketdevs.ph/" target="_blank"> 
                    Pocket devs</a>,<b><i> someday I'll be founding a business like that with my 
                    friends</i></b>, last year I try creating my <b>portfolio website</b> by <strong><i>watching youtube</i></strong> 
                    and understand each part of it then try to clone it and this is what it looks like 
                    <a href="https://lucy-furr.github.io/Marcallenguillermo/" target="_blank"> click me</a> <b>its not that responsive</b> 
                    because <b><i>I'm still exploring JavaScript</i></b>, hopefully at the end of the semester, I will be able to put some 
                    <b><i>more advance features.</i></b>
                </p>

            <!--chat gpt was my favorite website not because of using ai as my assignment maker, i use it acting as google like
            instead of searching the web, i just ask ai the questions I want to know specially when the question is situational,
            I just encountered one, like one small business call me to fix all I know about their computer then one time I discovered 
            that they using usb to transfer data from old computer and OS(window 7) and unfortunately all their active data
            (records from 2023 to 2024) is in the usb and have a trojan horse, then when I plug the usb to the new computer 
            running windows 11 all their data in usb was gone, remove by windows defender, I use chat gpt to describe the situation 
            and fortunately I recovered all their data and copy all the data to another usb drive. so chat gpt was my favorite website-->
